The call to `app.expose(obj)` below defaults to exposing the properties to `express.*`, so for example `express.views`, `express.title`, etc.\n\n      app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\n      app.set('view engine', 'jade');\n      app.set('title', 'Example');\n      app.set('default language', 'en');\n\n      app.expose(app.settings);\n\n  Another use-case would be exposing helper methods, perhaps the same ones as you are currently exposing to templates. Below we expose the `math` object as utilities to our templates, as well as the client-side. Within a template we would call `add(1,2)`, and on the CS we would call `utils.add(1,2)`, since we have passed the namespace \"utils\".\n\n      var math = { add: function(a,b){ return a + b; } };\n      app.expose(math, 'utils').helpers(math);\n      \n  Sometimes you might want to output to a different area, so for this we can pass an additional param \"languages\" which tells express which buffer to write to, which ends up providing us with the local variable \"languages\" in our template, where the default is \"javascript\".\n\n      app.expose({ en: 'English', fr: 'French' }, 'express', 'languages');\n\n  You'll then want to output the default buffer (or others) to your template, in Jade this would look something like:\n  \n      script!= javascript\n\n  And in EJS:\n  \n      <script><%- javascript %></script>\n\n### Raw JavaScript\n\n  It is also possible to expose \"raw\" javascript strings.\n\n      app.expose('var some = \"variable\";');\n\n  Optionally passing the destination buffer, providing us with the \"head\" local variable, instead of the default of \"javascript\".\n  \n      app.expose('var some = \"variable\";', 'head');\n\n### Exposing Functions\n\n  Exposing a named function is easy too, simply pass it in with an optional buffer name for placement within a template much like above.\n\n      app.expose(function someFunction(){\n        return 'yay';\n      }, 'foot');\n\n### Self-Calling Functions\n\n   Another alternative is passing an anonymous function, which executes itself, creating a \"wrapper\" function.\n\n      app.expose(function(){\n        function notify() {\n          alert('this will execute right away :D');\n        }\n        notify();\n      });\n\n### Exposing Entire Modules\n\n Exposing an entire module as-is is possible as well, this primarily\n useful when the module relies on internal closures and state.\n\n The following exposes \"color.dark()\", \"color.light()\" etc by default based\n on the basename of the `path` given, however we pass \"utils.color\" as a custom namespace.\n\n     app.exposeModule(__dirname + '/color', 'utils.color');\n\n### Request-Level Exposure\n\n Finally we can apply all of the above at the request-level as well, below we expose \"express.current.user\" as `{ name: 'tj' }`, for the specific request only.\n\n      app.get('/', function(req, res){\n        var user = { name: 'tj' };\n        res.expose(user, 'express.current.user');\n        res.render('index', { layout: false });\n      });\n\n### CommonJS Modules\n\n  Similarly we can enable a light-weight commonjs require() implementation simply by calling:\n  \n     app.exposeRequire();\n\n  From that point on, the `namespace` is no longer a dot-delimited property, but a slash-delimited path, for example the following would allow us to `require('utils/color')` within the browser.\n\n     app.exposeModule(__dirname + '/color', 'utils/color');\n\n  By default the path defaults to the basename of the path used to load the module's contents, so we could remove \"utils/color\", allowing us to `require('color')`.\n\n  The primary benefit of utilizing require() here, is that `color`, or any other module can use require() internally, and as long as we expose those modules as well, they will work in the browser.\n\n  This of course works for things a side from modules as well:\n  \n       app.expose(app.settings, 'settings');\n\n  Which we can then require in our client:\n  \n       require('settings')\n\n       // => {\n           default language: \"en\"\n         , env: \"development\"\n         , hints: true\n         , home: \"/\"\n         , title: \"Example\"\n         , view engine: \"jade\"\n         , views: \"/Users/tj/Projects/express-expose/examples/views\"\n       }\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
